# turn-off-retweets

This is the source for https://turn-off-retweets.glitch.me/, a small website to help you turn off
Twitter retweets for the people you follow.

It's hosted using a really fun hosted platform called [Glitch](https://glitch.me). If you want to
fork it, you can [remix it with Glitch](https://glitch.me/#!/remix/turn-off-retweets/) -- just edit
the `.env` file with a session secret and your Twitter app credentials and you'll be good to go!
